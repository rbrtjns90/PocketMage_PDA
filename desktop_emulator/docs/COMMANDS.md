Some fun hidden responses:

| `home` | "You're home, silly!" |
| `hello` | "Hey, you!" |
| `hi` | "What's up?" |
| `i love you` | "luv u 2 <3" |
| `alexa` | "..." |

## Tips

1. Commands are **case-insensitive** - `TXT` and `txt` both work
2. Use **number shortcuts** for fastest access (just press `1` + Enter)
3. Press **ESC** anytime to return to the home screen
4. The OLED bar at the bottom shows what you're typing
